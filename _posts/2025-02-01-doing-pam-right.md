Effective Privileged Access Management (PAM) defines the line between secure operations and breach risk. Many organizations face recurring pitfalls that create inefficiencies, technical debt, and vulnerabilities.

Based on extensive field experience with CyberArk solutions, this guide outlines strategies to avoid errors and build a scalable PAM framework.

## Mistake #1: Inadequate Discovery

Organizations frequently fail to map their privileged access attack surface comprehensively. Privileged accounts exist on every system, application, and cloud platform across the organization. Without thorough discovery, gaps in privileged account management become potential threats.

Discovery is essential for successful PAM, providing continuous visibility into privileged credentials and risk areas. CyberArk Discovery tools automate these efforts by scanning environments to detect privileged accounts, service accounts, and embedded credentials. In cloud infrastructures, CyberArk’s Cloud Entitlements Manager (CEM) evaluates permission hierarchies, exposing misconfigurations and excessive privileges that could lead to exploitation.

With such insights, organizations prioritize high-risk accounts for immediate protection. Cloud-native applications, where ephemeral accounts proliferate, require ongoing discovery to maintain security boundaries. CyberArk’s Endpoint Privilege Manager (EPM) enhances discovery by tracking inappropriate permission use at endpoints.

Upon completing discovery, organizations should implement safeguards like multi-factor authentication (MFA), access controls, and secure storage in CyberArk’s Digital Vault. The CyberArk Blueprint provides detailed guidance to organize these protections effectively. These strategies mitigate risks by controlling access to sensitive systems.

## Mistake #2: Underestimating Automation

Manual PAM operations introduce risks and inefficiencies through human errors in credential rotation, account provisioning, and compliance monitoring.

Automation transforms PAM by eliminating human error, accelerating processes, and ensuring policy adherence. CyberArk’s automation capabilities facilitate password rotation, account onboarding, and real-time monitoring. The Central Credential Provider API automates secure password retrieval for applications, reducing the operational overhead of manual access control.

Profitable automation initiatives may include:

- **Onboarding and Offboarding:** Streamlining account provisioning and deprovisioning minimizes security gaps by addressing dormant accounts quickly and efficiently.
- **Audit Reporting:** Automated compliance reports save considerable time, maintaining audit readiness without manual aggregation.
- **Threat Detection:** Automated responses to unusual activity enhance incident response, shortening breach detection timelines.

Organizations can explore automation with the CyberArk Bruno REST API Collections available on GitHub, providing practical solutions to strengthen PAM operations.

## Mistake #3: Inadequate Documentation

Without robust documentation, PAM implementations lose effectiveness over time. These programs often outlast their administrators, leading to operational confusion when procedures are undocumented amidst personnel changes, evolving systems, and unforeseen incidents.

Effective documentation provides both technical and user-facing clarity. Runbooks offer administrators detailed instructions for recurring tasks like account management and issue resolution. End-user guides simplify interaction with PAM interfaces, promoting secure practices.

Platforms like intranet wikis, centralized document management systems, and interactive knowledge bases help maintain and distribute updated documentation. Regularly updated repositories ensure that documentation evolves with the organization’s technology landscape. These records also bolster compliance by demonstrating adherence to documented privilege management protocols.

## Mistake #4: Ignoring Security Best Practices

A robust PAM strategy requires unwavering attention to security fundamentals. Weak points such as outdated protocols and inadequate encryption persist when organizations overlook best practices.

Organizations should first replace self-signed certificates with trusted CA-issued certificates for all PAM infrastructure and users. Strengthening certificate integrity fortifies component communication. Following this, encrypt all PAM-related network traffic, including connections through the Privileged Session Manager (PSM) and component-to-component communications, ensuring sensitive data is secure.

Additionally, organizations must phase out legacy algorithms like SHA-1, adopting modern cryptographic standards. Integrating PAM with Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) platforms enhances visibility, enabling rapid detection of privileged access anomalies.

## Mistake #5: Neglecting End-User Experience

User resistance can undermine PAM security, leading to risky behaviors like storing credentials in unsecured locations. Poorly designed workflows may also prompt users to connect to privileged targets outside of documented methods, bypassing security controls and increasing the risk of unauthorized access.

User-centric design mitigates this risk. Features like intuitive interfaces, adaptive MFA, and self-service portals simplify access procedures while maintaining security. Regular feedback collection highlights pain points, guiding system refinements to encourage adoption.

Improved usability not only secures compliance but also enhances operational efficiency by reducing friction between security protocols and productivity. Establishing feedback loops and acting on suggestions ensures continuous improvement and fosters stronger user adoption.

## Mistake #6: Inadequate Training Program

PAM success depends on informed users who can follow secure protocols and minimize risks. When training is insufficient, users may unintentionally create vulnerabilities by mismanaging privileged access or overlooking security practices.

Effective training programs must cover both technical processes and broader security principles. The unofficial CyberArk Program Acceptance Toolkit offers structured resources, including training videos, dozens of communication templates, and automation templates to foster hands-on learning and retention of critical skills.

Ongoing awareness campaigns strengthen this training, reinforcing best practices and adapting to evolving security landscapes. Monitoring tools help track user engagement and the effectiveness of these initiatives, ensuring continuous compliance and secure privilege management throughout the organization.

## Mistake #7: Poor Enterprise Integration

Isolated PAM systems hinder both security and operational efficiency by creating silos that require manual coordination across various tools and platforms. Effective PAM programs integrate with identity management, incident response, and audit platforms to streamline operations and reduce manual effort.

For instance, connecting PAM to a Security Operations Center (SOC) allows for real-time monitoring of privileged activities, enabling swift threat detection and response. Identity governance systems ensure that account changes synchronize across the organization, preventing security gaps caused by outdated or inconsistent access permissions. Automated ticketing system integrations enhance account management by handling approval workflows, access provisioning, and deprovisioning tasks with minimal manual input.

Additionally, PAM integration with cloud platforms strengthens security by enforcing consistent policies across both on-premises and cloud environments. These integrations provide a unified view of privileged access, helping organizations maintain control and consistently apply privilege. This reduces errors, accelerates response times, and enhances compliance monitoring across diverse infrastructures.

## Conclusion: Building a Resilient Strategy

Privileged Access Management is an ongoing initiative. Sustained success requires a commitment to continuous improvement, automation, and adherence to best practices. By addressing common pitfalls, organizations safeguard sensitive assets and strengthen their security posture against evolving threats.
